My name is Alejandra Silva, and I am an international student from Peru pursuing a Master of Public Policy (MPP) at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics from Universidad del Pacífico and earned the Financial Risk Manager (FRM) certification in 2022.  

I have over six years of experience in financial regulation and public finance, having worked at the Superintendency of Banking, Insurance, and Pension Funds of Peru (SBS), where I held positions such as Banking Supervisor and Economic Research Analyst. I led macroprudential policy efforts aligned with Basel III standards, designed national financial relief programs during the COVID-19 crisis, and created regulatory tools using SQL, R, and geospatial data to enhance financial inclusion and systemic risk oversight.

Most recently, I have contributed to financial innovation at the Office of the Illinois State Treasurer and the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. My work includes building dashboards for public investment funds, improving prepaid card access for college savers, and co-developing SupTech applications with regulators across Latin America, Africa, and Asia.  

My academic interests focus on public finance, financial inclusion, and the use of data and technology for better policy. My goal is to bridge finance and policy to design inclusive and resilient financial systems—especially for underserved communities in emerging markets.
