I’m Alejandra Silva, a Financial Risk Manager (FRM) and economist with 7+ years of experience applying data analytics and technology to strengthen financial systems and inform public policy. My work spans Latin America, the U.S., and globally, supporting financial regulators, public institutions, and multilateral initiatives.

At Peru’s Financial Supervisory Authority, I led initiatives to modernize regulation, implement COVID-19 relief policies, and develop systemic risk tools using SQL, R, and geospatial data. At the Illinois State Treasurer’s Office, I built BI dashboards to support liquidity planning, evaluated investment strategies, and produced research to expand access to financial products and secure digital equity grants. At the Cambridge SupTech Lab, I co-developed technology-based solutions with financial authorities and central banks across Latin America, Africa, and Asia.

My goal is to apply data-driven approaches to improve public decision-making, advance financial inclusion, and support resilient and equitable economic growth.
