My name is Alejandra Silva, and I am an international student from Peru pursuing a Master of Public Policy (MPP) at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics from Universidad del Pacífico and earned the Financial Risk Manager (FRM) certification in 2022.

I have over six years of experience in data analytics and finance. At the Superintendency of Banking, Insurance, and Pension Funds of Peru (SBS), I worked on aligning financial regulation with international standards, supported the design of national financial relief measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and developed tools using SQL, R, and geospatial data to monitor systemic risk and promote financial inclusion.

Most recently, I contributed to financial innovation at the Office of the Illinois State Treasurer and the Cambridge SupTech Lab. My work included building predictive dashboards to support liquidity management, developing products to expand access to college savings accounts and financial education, and co-developing technology-based solutions with financial authorities and central banks across Latin America, Africa, and Asia.

My academic interests lie in public finance, inclusive growth, and the application of data and technology to improve public policy. I’m driven by the goal of building more inclusive, resilient financial systems—especially in emerging markets.
